        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>Read below to find out how the game is played!</p>
      </section>

      <article>
        <h3>SET UP</h3>
        <p>
          Players split up into two teams of similar size and skill. You need at
          least four players (two teams of two) for a standard game. Variants
          for two or three players can be found on the back page. Each team
          chooses one player to be their spymaster. Both spymasters sit on the
          same side of the table. The other players sit across from their
          spymasters. They are field operatives. Randomly choose 25 codenames
          and place them on the table in a 5-by-5 grid. Note: While shuffling
          the codename cards, be sure to flip over half the deck once in a
          while. This will mix the words more thoroughly.
        </p>

        <h4>THE KEY</h4>
        <p>
          Each game has one key that reveals the secret identities of the cards
          on the table. The spymasters should choose the key card randomly and
          slide it into the stand between them. Any side can be up. Don't think
          about it. Just slide it into the stand. And don't let the field
          operatives see it.
        </p>

        <h4>STARTING TEAM</h4>
        <p>
          The four lights around the edge of the key card indicate which team
          starts. The starting team has 9 words to guess. The other team has 8.
          The starting team will give the first clue of the game
        </p>

        <h4>AGENT CARDS</h4>
        <p>
          The red agent cards go in a stack in front of the red spymaster. The
          blue agent cards should be in front of the blue spymaster. This helps
          everyone remember which team they are on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The double agent belongs to whichever team starts. Flip it to that
          team's color. It will be one of that team's agent cards for the
          duration of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          The innocent bystander cards and the assassin should be kept in
          between, where both spymasters can reach them easily.
        </p>

        <h3>GAME OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>
          Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates
          know the agents only by their codenames. Spymasters take turns giving
          one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. The
          field operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When
          a field operative touches a word, the spymaster reveals its secret
          identity. If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue
          guessing, until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they
          hit a wrong person. Then it is the other team's turn to give a clue
          and guess. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>GAME PLAY</h3>
        <p>
          Teams take turns. The starting team is indicated by the 4 lights on
          the edges of the key card.
        </p>

        <h4>GIVING A CLUE</h4>
        <p>
          If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue
          that relates to some of the words your team is trying to guess. When
          you think you have a good clue, you say it. You also say one number,
          which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your
          clue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: Two of your words are NUT and BARK. Both of these grow on
          trees, so you say tree: 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are allowed to give a clue for only one word (cashew: 1 ) but it's
          fun to try for two or more. Getting four words with one clue is a big
          accomplishment.
        </p>

        <h4>One Word</h4>
        <p>
          Your clue must be only one word. You are not allowed to give extra
          hints. For example, don't say, "This may be a bit of a stretch…" You
          are playing Codenames. It's always a bit of a stretch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your clue cannot be any of the codenames visible on the table. On
          later turns, some codenames will be covered up, so a clue that is not
          legal now might be legal later.
        </p>

        <h4>MAKING CONTACT</h4>
        <p>
          When the spymaster gives a clue, his or her field operatives try to
          figure out what it means. They can debate it amongst themselves, but
          the spymaster must keep a straight face. The operatives indicate their
          official guess when one of them touches one of the codenames on the
          table.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the field operative touches a card belonging to his or her team,
            the spymaster covers the word with an agent card in that color. The
            operatives get another guess (but not another clue).
          </li>
          <li>
            If the field operative touches an innocent bystander, the spymaster
            covers it with an innocent bystander card. This ends the turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the field operative touches a card belonging to the other team,
            the word is covered by one of the other team's agent cards. This
            ends the turn. (And it helps the other team.)
          </li>
          <li>
            If the field operative touches the assassin, the word is covered by
            the assassin card. This ends the game! The team that contacted the
            assassin loses.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Tip</b>: Before saying your clue out loud, make sure it doesn't
          relate to the assassin.
        </p>

        <h4>Number of Guesses</h4>
        <p>
          The field operatives must always make at least one guess. Any wrong
          guess ends the turn immediately, but if the field operatives guess a
          word of their team's color, they can keep guessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can stop guessing at any time, but usually you want to guess as
          many words as the spymaster said. Sometimes you might even want to
          guess one more:
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: Red Team's first clue was tree: 2. The red operative wanted
          to guess ORANGE and NUT. She guessed ORANGE first. That was an
          innocent bystander, so she did not get a chance to guess NUT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue Team took a turn and correctly guessed two words. Now it is Red
          Team's turn again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The red spymaster says river: 3. The red operative is pretty sure the
          AMAZON is a river, so she touches that card. The spymaster covers it
          with a red agent card, so she gets to go again. A river has a BED, so
          she touches that codename. It's also red, so she can go again.
        </p>
        <p>
          She's not sure of the third river word. She picks NUT. This has
          nothing to do with river. She is guessing a word from the previous
          clue.
        </p>
        <p>
          NUT is a red word. The operative has made 3 correct guesses for the
          clue river: 3. She is allowed one final guess. She can try to find the
          third river word, or she can try to find the other tree word. Or she
          can stop at three and let Blue Team have a turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are allowed only one extra guess. In the example above, the red
          operative would be allowed 4 guesses because her spymaster said the
          number 3. When the field operatives say they are done guessing (or
          when they guess wrong) it is the other team's turn.
        </p>

        <h4>GAME FLOW</h4>
        <p>
          Spymasters take turns giving clues. After a spymaster gives a clue,
          his or her team starts guessing. Their turn ends when they guess
          wrong, when they decide to stop, or when they have made the maximum
          number of guesses for that clue. Then it is the other team's turn.
        </p>

        <h4>ENDING THE GAME</h4>
        <p>
          The game ends when one team has all their words covered. That team
          wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to win on the other team's turn if they guess your last
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game can end early if a field operative makes contact with the
          assassin. That operative's team loses.
        </p>

        <h4>Set up for the Next Game</h4>
        <p>
          Do other people want a chance to be spymasters? Setup for the second
          game is easy. Remove the cards covering the codenames and put them
          back in their stacks. Now just flip over the 25 codenames, and you're
          ready to go!
        </p>

        <h3>PENALTY FOR INVALID CLUES</h3>
        <p>
          If a spymaster gives an invalid clue, the team's turn ends
          immediately. As an additional penalty, the other team's spymaster may
          cover one of his or her words with an agent card before giving the
          next clue.
        </p>
        <p>But if no one notices that a clue is invalid, it counts as valid.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>KEEPING A STRAIGHT FACE</h3>
        <p>
          The spymaster is expected to keep a straight face. Do not reach for
          any card while your teammates are considering the words. When a
          teammate touches a word, consult the key card and cover the word with
          the card of the corresponding color. When a teammate chooses a word of
          the correct color, you should act as though it was exactly the word
          you meant, even if it wasn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a field operative, you should focus on the table when you
          are making your guesses. Do not make eye contact with the spymaster
          while you are guessing. This will help you avoid nonverbal cues.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your information is strictly limited to what can be conveyed with
          one word and one number, you are playing in the spirit of the game.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>VALID CLUES</h3>
        <p>
          We playtested various rules. Some groups like the rules one way. Some
          like the rules another way. You should experiment to find out what
          your group likes.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>FIRM RULES</h3>
        <p>
          Some clues are invalid because they violate the spirit of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your clue must be about the meaning of the words. You can't use your
          clue to talk about the letters in a word or its position on the table.
          Gland is not a valid clue for ENGLAND. You can't tie BUG, BED, and BOW
          together with a clue like b: 3 nor with a clue like three: 3. However
          …
        </p>
        <p>
          Letters and numbers are valid clues, as long as they refer to
          meanings. You can use X: 1 as a clue for RAY. You can use eight: 3 as
          a clue for BALL, FIGURE, and OCTOPUS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number you say after your clue can't be used as a clue. Citrus: 8
          is not a valid clue for LEMON and OCTOPUS.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must play in English. A foreign word is allowed only if the
          players in your group would use it in an English sentence. For
          example, you can't use Apfel as a clue for APPLE and BERLIN, but you
          can use strudel.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can't say any form of a visible word on the table. Until BREAK is
          covered up by a card, you can't say break, broken, breakage, or
          breakdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can't say part of a compound word on the table. Until HORSESHOE is
          covered up, you can't say horse, shoe, unhorsed, or snowshoe.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>HOMONYMS & SPELLING</h3>
        <p>
          English has many homonyms and homophones. E. g. night sounds like
          knight, but these two words don't mean the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Same-sounding words with different meanings and different spellings
          are considered different words. So you can't give knight-related clues
          for NIGHT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Words that are spelled the same are considered the same even though
          they might have different pronunciations and meanings. For example,
          actors take a bow and the bow is part of a ship, so you could use bow
          as a clue for THEATER and SHIP. You could also use it as a clue for
          archery-related things, even though that bow is pronounced
          differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are allowed to spell out your clue. For example, if you want your
          teammates to guess THEATER and STRING, you can spell out b-o-w without
          committing to a pronunciation. You can give the clue k-n-i-g-h-t even
          when NIGHT is one of the codenames on the table. (But you can't use
          t-h-e-a-t-r-e when THEATER is on the table. Theatre and theater are
          different forms of the same word.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You should spell out your clue if someone asks. If you aren't that
          strong on spelling, ask the opposing spymaster for help.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tip</b>: Spelling is not just for homonyms. It's also useful when
          the room is noisy or when the players have very different accents.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>DON'T BE TOO STRICT</h3>
        <p>
          England and island were originally compound words, but in this
          century, island is a valid clue for ENGLAND. Even land is a valid clue
          for ENGLAND. And anybody who says you can't say sparrow when ROW is on
          the table is just trying to cause trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the opposing spymaster allows it, the clue is valid. If you aren't
          sure, ask your opponent. (Quietly, so the others can't hear.)
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>FLEXIBLE RULES</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes you have to make judgment calls about what is valid and what
          is not. Different groups may prefer to play the game differently.
        </p>

        <h4>Compound Words</h4>
        <p>
          English has three ways to write a compound word. Greenhouse is one
          word. Pack rat is two words. Mother-in-law is hyphenated. Technically,
          only greenhouse can be a one-word clue.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can decide to allow any compound words. However, in no case should
          a player be allowed to invent compound words. Lunar squid is not a
          valid clue for MOON and OCTOPUS.
        </p>

        <h4>Proper Names</h4>
        <p>
          Proper names are always valid clues if they follow the other rules.
          George is a valid clue, but you might want to specify whether you mean
          George Washington or George W. Bush. Your group can agree to count
          proper names as one word. This would also allow titles such as The
          Three Musketeers. Even if you don't allow multiword proper names, you
          might want to make an exception for place names like New York.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spymasters should not be allowed to make up names, not even names that
          turn out to be real. Sue Mee is not a valid clue for CHINA and LAWYER.
        </p>

        <h4>Acronmys and Abbreviations</h4>
        <p>
          Technically, CIA is not one word. But it is a great clue. You can
          decide to allow common abbreviations like UK, lol, and PhD. And words
          like laser, radar, and sonar are always allowed, even though they
          originated as acronyms.
        </p>

        <h4>Homonyms</h4>
        <p>
          Some people prefer to allow a more liberal use of homonyms. You can
          allow knight to be a clue for night-related things if that makes the
          game more fun for you.
        </p>

        <h4>Rhymes</h4>
        <p>
          Rhymes are always valid when they refer to meanings. Snail is a valid
          clue for MAIL because this rhyme is a common phrase. Snail is also a
          valid clue for WHALE because they are both animals. Snail is not a
          valid clue for SCALE because their main association is through the
          sound of the words. (If someone in your group has a job weighing
          snails, however, this clue is perfectly fine.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people like to allow any kind of rhyming clue. If you decide to
          allow this, just remember that you aren't allowed to indicate you are
          giving a rhyming clue. Your operatives will have to figure that out
          for themselves.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>EXPERT CLUE: ZERO</h3>
        <p>
          You are allowed to use 0 as the number part of your clue. For example,
          feathers: 0 means, "None of our words relate to feathers."
        </p>
        <p>
          If 0 is the number, the usual limit on guesses does not apply. Field
          operatives can guess as many words as they want. They still must guess
          at least one word.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not sure why this is useful, don't worry. You'll figure it
          out.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>EXERPT CLUE: UNLIMITED</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes you may have multiple unguessed words related to clues from
          the previous rounds. If you want your team to guess more than one of
          them, you may say unlimited instead of a number. For example feathers:
          unlimited.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disadvantage is that the field operatives do not know how many
          words are related to the new clue. The advantage is that they may
          guess as many words as they want.

        <h3>WITH FEWER PLAYERS</h3>

        <h4>Two-Player Game</h4>
        <p>
          If there are only two of you, you can play on the same team. This
          two-player variant also works for larger groups of people who don't
          feel like competing against each other. You will try to get a high
          score against a simulated opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set up the game as usual. One player will be the spymaster and the
          rest will be field operatives. The other team has no players, but you
          still need their stack of agent cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your team should go first, so be sure to pick a key card that makes
          you the starting team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Play your turns as usual. Try to avoid enemy agents and the assassin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spymaster simulates the enemy team by covering up 1 of their words
          each time they get a turn. The spymaster gets to choose which word is
          covered, so there is a bit of strategy here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your team contacts the assassin, or if all the enemy agents are
          contacted, you lose. There is no score.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your team wins, give yourselves a score based on how many agent
          cards are still left in the enemy's stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Your score will be determined by how many turns you needed and
          also by how many enemy agents you contacted accidentally.
        </p>

        <h4>Three-Player Game</h4>
        <p>
          Three players who want to be on the same team can play as described
          above. If two players want to compete against each other, they can be
          spymasters and the third player can be their operative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setup and game play are as usual, except that the single field
          operative is working for both sides. (Just like spies in real life!)
          The winning spymaster is determined in the usual way. The field
          operative tries to do a good job for both sides.
